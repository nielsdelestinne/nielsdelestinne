### So you've found my GitHub profile, welcome! 👋

> Most code you will find on here is the result of me tinkering around. Please do not treat it as a professional showcase / portfolio, **because neither do I**.

On here, you will find:
- 🕹️ Hobby projects (which I always start, but not always finish 😄)
- 🧪 Experiments
- ⚡ Spikes
- 📄 Snippets
- _And other things_

Feel free to use whatever code you find & happy programming!
