### So you've found my GitHub profile, welcome! 👋

Here is where I store all of my
- 🕹️ Hobby projects (which I always start, but not always finish 😄)
- 🧪 Experiments
- ⚡ Spikes
- 📄 Snippets
- _And other things_

> Pleae do not treat every repository on here as a representation of my professional skill as a software developer, **because neither do I**. 

Feel free to use whatever code you find & happy programming!
